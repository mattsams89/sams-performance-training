abstract: 
  'As athletes become well trained, they
  require greater stimuli and variation to force adaptation. One
  means of adding additional variation is the use of cluster loading. Cluster loading involves introducing interrepetition rest
  during a set, which in theory may allow athletes to train at
  higher absolute intensities for the same volume. The purpose
  of this study was to investigate the kinetic and kinematic implications of cluster loading as a resistance training programming tactic compared with traditional loading (TL). Eleven
  resistance-trained men (age = 26.75 6 3.98 years, height =
  181.36 6 5.96 cm, body mass = 89.83 6 10.66 kg, and
  relative squat strength = 1.84 6 0.34) were recruited for this
  study. Each subject completed 2 testing sessions consisting of
  3 sets of 5 back squats at 80% of their 1 repetition maximum
  with 3 minutes of interset rest. Cluster loading included 30
  seconds of interrepetition rest with 3 minutes of interset rest.
  All testing was performed on dual-force plates sampling at
  1,000 Hz, and the barbell was connected to 4 linear position
  transducers sampling at 1,000 Hz. Both conditions had similar
  values for peak force, concentric average force, and eccentric
  average force (p = 0.25, effect size (ES) = 0.09, p = 0.25, ES
  = 0.09, and p = 0.60, ES = 0.04, respectively). Cluster loading
  had significantly higher peak power (PP) (p , 0.001, ES =
  0.77), peak and average velocities (p , 0.001, ES = 0.77,
  and p , 0.001, ES = 0.81, respectively), lower times to PP
  and velocity (p , 0.001, ES = 20.68, and p , 0.001, ES =
  20.68, respectively) as well as greater maintenance of time to
  PP (p , 0.001, ES = 1.57). These results suggest that cluster
  loading may be superior to TL when maintaining power output
  and time point variables is the desired outcome of training.'
