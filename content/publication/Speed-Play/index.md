abstract: "Within track & field, various models exist regarding the macro-management of speed enhancement. For instance, coaches may subscribe to a short-to-long, long-to-short, or concurrent system to inform global progressions within the allocated preparation time. Though these themes speak to how a plan conceptually attempts to advance the skills of sprinting along with specific fitness, these overarching modes of training are superficial and lmiited in their scope as it relates to the micro-level management of planning. Specifically, these broad models fail to provide insightful perspective that allows the coach to carefully deliver nuanced programming, and more importantly, instruct a speed development session with precision. In other words, having greater clarity on both the intended goals and actual outcomes of a given sprint tactic or drill may improve a coach's ability to deliver targeted cues or verbal instruction. As a result, the motor-learning effects of properly designed sprint-skill development sessions are augmented through informed and artful coaching. While the development and practice of coaching should be grounded in evidence, they are often separated--causing a detrimental dissociation between the aspects of curriculum delivery, skill analysis, and movement modification. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to arm coaches with a logical progression of tactics that develops sprint skill while considering the temporal aspects of high-velocity running."
